# Focus
A timer to help you alternate between phases of focused work and relaxation

## Motivation
Apart from wanting to develop healthier work habits, I was interested in creating an offline web app, trying the HTML5 audio tag, and see how all of that performs on various devices.

## Getting started
View the demo at [http://homecamp.de/focus](http://homecamp.de/focus)

## Usage
When you first load the timer it will start in focus mode. Once 45 minutes have passed, the timer is going to switch to relax mode for 15 minutes. This is repeated infinitely as long as you keep the browser window open.

**Switch** between focus and relax mode immediately by pressing the text indicating the current mode above the time readout.

Tapping the time readout **pauses** the timer.

To toggle between the **black-on-white** and **white-on-black** tap the the circular indicator.

Pressing and holding the circular indicator allows you to  **fast forward**.

You can **reload** the browser window at any time. The current mode and remaining time will be restored.

Use your browserâ€™s built-in zoom feature to control the **size** of the timer.

With [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com) you can create a stand-alone focus timer application on your Mac.
